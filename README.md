# BT2103
A repository containing BT2103 project-related work.

In this project, we were given the [Default of Credit Card](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset) dataset and were required to perform relevant data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and generate models to effectively predict if a person would default on their credit card given the information we know about them.
